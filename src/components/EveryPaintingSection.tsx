            Painting is more than just colors on a canvasâ€”it is a reflection of
            emotion, experience, and imagination. Through every artwork, I aim
            to create something meaningful, something that resonates with the
            viewer on a personal level.

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg font-light text-black leading-relaxed mb-6 opacity-0 translate-y-10 animate-on-scroll">
            Whether it's the soft petals of a blooming flower, the vast openness
            of a scenic landscape, or the expressive strokes of an abstract
            composition, my work is deeply inspired by the beauty that surrounds
            us. I believe that art has the power to evoke feelings, tell
            stories, and transform spaces. My goal is to create paintings that
            are not only visually striking but also emotionally engaging.
          </p>

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg font-light text-black leading-relaxed relative opacity-0 translate-y-10 animate-on-scroll">
            I create with the hope that my paintings will bring joy,
            inspiration, and a sense of connection to those who view them. Art
            has the ability to speak to the soul, and I strive to make each
            piece a reflection of both the world around us and the emotions
            within us. As an artist, I am constantly evolving, seeking new ways
            to express the essence of life through color, movement, and
            imagination.
